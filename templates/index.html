          DRUG REPURPOSING?
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning or reprofiling, is
          the process of identifying new uses for existing drugs that are
          already approved for other indications. Instead of developing entirely
          new drugs, researchers and pharmaceutical companies explore the
          therapeutic potential of existing drugs for different diseases or
          conditions. This approach offers several advantages, including faster
          development timelines, lower development costs, and reduced risks
          compared to developing entirely newly compounds.

                  The process of drug repurposing involves a combination of
                  computational approaches, high-throughput screening, and
                  preclinical and clinical studies to identify new therapeutic
                  indications.

                We are aiming here to show simply that analogy vectors are
                likely useful. We will explain that further analogy based
                analysis will be useful for establishing links between drugs and
                targets and targets to disease which will further filter
                candidates prior to expensive wet lab validation. We see this
                method as a potentially helpful tool for quickly prioritizing
                drug candidates for further investigation. Rather than providing
                automated in-depth support for candidate drugs, we would expect
                researchers to use our method to conduct initial literature
                search, thereby accelerating the process of choosing promising
                candidates for more in-depth in vitro and in vivo testing. we
                see this work as providing a quick and powerful summarization of
                leads within the literature and helping to prioritize research
                in promising directions. We will attempt to clarify this intent
                in the resubmission !!!
